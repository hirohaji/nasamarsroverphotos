# Mars Rover Photos

This is a project in React.js (in /client) to consume a NASA API providing images gathered by Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers on Mars. Their objective is to make it more easily available to other developers, educators, and citizen scientists. Feel free to contact me.

The project starts a Node.js server to call the Nasa API hidding the private key, then it starts the React.js client.
